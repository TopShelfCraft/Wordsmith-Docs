- The `tweetify` function was originally created by [Michael Rog](https://michaelrog.com) for the [Tweetify](https://github.com/RogEE/Tweetify) plugin for ExpressionEngine.

- The [CE String](https://docs.causingeffect.com/expressionengine/ce-string/index.html) plugin for ExpressionEngine, by the incomparable [Aaron Waldon](https://www.causingeffect.com/), saved me (and countless other developers) thousands of tedious hours. I am eternally grateful.
